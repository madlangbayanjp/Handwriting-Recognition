# InstaGrade: An Automated Grading Scanner Using Text Recognition

InstaGrade is developed using Flutter(Dart) and is a final project for our mobile application subject. This project efficiently grades students' identification answers just by scanning it into the students' answer sheets. This project aims to reduce the workload of our teachers and simplify the grading of each student's papers.
